# DatabaseProject
### DBMS course project.

This project involve using SQLite for the database back end and Java for the front end. A GUI was created to make logging into the database and managing the information easy for the user. This project was made as a boardgame/tabletop game library to allow the owner to add/remove/modify games in the database. Other users are able to search the database and obtain information about the game.

Future developement of this project would allow the owner a way to schedule game nights based on what games other users check off as "want to play." Also, integration to an online database for game info and purchase locations was planned.

- Project idea proposed by me and accepted by the team
- GUI created/programmed by me
